###Setting up plotly!

The first thing you need to do is head to this page: https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/

Plotly drops a `.plotly` directory in your home directory on your machine the first time you import it (if it doesn't already exist).

In the upper-right hand corner, there's a link to sign-up or one to sign-in. If you haven't done so, set up an account (otherwise you won't be able to have some fun with streaming later in the tutorial).

There's a command line expression in there that will be specialized for your account, you'll just need to copy and paste it into your terminal to get going.

If the `.plotly` directory is setup for you, you won't ever have to remember, look up, or type in, your api-key, it will just be saved on your machine.
